**Interactive 3D Heart Visualization**
This repository hosts an advanced interactive 3D visualization project designed using React and Three.js via the React Three Fiber library. The primary feature of this project is an anatomically accurate, interactive heart model that allows users to toggle between a static and a beating heart, enhanced by realistic textures and materials.
This project is designed to support educational purposes and medical training, offering both an immersive visualization experience and interactivity through audio-visual effects.

**Features**
1. Realistic Heart Model
The main focus is on creating a high-fidelity 3D model of the human heart, using multiple textures like albedo, specular, normal, glossiness, ambient occlusion (AO), and emission maps.
Users can view the static model or interactively toggle to a dynamic, beating heart animation.
2. Interactive Components
Supports double-click interaction to toggle the heart between static and beating modes.
Accompanied by a realistic heartbeat sound upon interaction.
3. 3D Models of Medical Instruments
Additional 3D models such as scalpel, monitor, and forceps are included to simulate a more comprehensive medical setting.
4. Dynamic Lighting and Emissive Effects
High-quality lighting, including ambient, directional, point, and spot lights with shadow-casting, creates an immersive scene.
Emissive effects simulate internal glowing areas, adding realism to the heart.

**Technology Stack**
React: Frontend framework for managing UI and state.
React Three Fiber: React renderer for Three.js, enabling the integration of 3D models within the React ecosystem.
Three.js: JavaScript 3D library that provides the foundation for all 3D effects, animations, and lighting.
GLTFLoader: Used to load GLTF 3D models, which are optimized for the web.
OrbitControls: Allows users to manipulate the camera around the 3D scene.
